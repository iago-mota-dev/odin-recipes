# odin-recipes
This is a project from the Odin Project.

This project is a simple html website, that contains various recipes with complete ingredients and steps to complete and make a awesome dish.

In this project i've practice how to create html web pages, lists, links, header and how to put images on the web page, since i already know how to do all of this, i am taking these projects to practice my skills and learn more with each.
